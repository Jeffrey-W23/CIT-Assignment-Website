					<p style="text-align:center;margin-top: 5px;margin-bottom: 80px;margin-right: 40px;margin-left: 40px;">We are a very new group to the Indie games game, and hope to feel right at home with everyone once we start doing some Jams, Building games, maybe some software too and overall getting nerdy stuff done. Anyway, once we get properly started with our company and everything, we hope to start throwing some games out there for everyone to enjoy. We hope that we will succeed. You'll here from us soon! Stay Tuned!</p>

					<p style="text-align:left;margin-bottom: 120px;">We have begun working on a new project called SpaceGame, its not too far into development as of yet, but we have a start! The game currently consists of a main menu with some very nice music, minimalistic yet neat graphics, a scrolling background, as well as the very first example of simple gameplay with a moveable character along with a camera that follows; and that is all.
					We plan to expand upon this prototype and push features into the game, until it fully meets our goals and expectations of ourselves, which are by no means short sighted.</p>

The game currently consists of two games modes Endless mode and Stuck in the Mud. This new games also has great music like SpaceGame, minimalistic yet neat graphics and a birds eye camera for the zombie killing action! We plan to add additional gamemodes Survival and Arcade Mode.</p>
